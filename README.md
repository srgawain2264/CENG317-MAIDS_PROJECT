PROJECT SUMMARY

The aim of the project was to build an affordable, reliable and simple self-monitoring home/business intruder detection system based on the Raspberry Pi 4 platform, motion (Passive Infrared Sensor) and sound sensors, and connected to the internet (IoT) to deliver home/business intrusion alerts via email (with intrusion picture), Android push notifications, phone call and SMS messaging after detecting an authenticated intrusion. The system was completed in the period between September 6, 2019 and October 30, 2019, delivering a human intrusion detection system using sound or infrared detection sensors with intrusion alerts delivered in real-time. 

PROJECT BACKGROUND

Break-ins occur every 90 seconds in Canada. [1] In 2015, statistics Canada showed that there were 159,338 burglaries across Canada and all types of properties. That is 444 reported burglaries per 100,000 persons. In other words, 4% of all Canadian households were burglarized; that is to say 1 out of 28 households were burglarized across the country. [2]

Close to home, in the City of Toronto, Statistics Canada reported that in 2018 there were 14,265 Break and entering cases reports; that is 227.36 reported burglaries per 100,000 persons, an increase of 3.81% from 2017. According to the report, 1,723 persons were charged with the offence; 145 youths between the ages of 12 and 17 years of age were charged. [3]

More disturbing, according to the Canadian Center for Justice Statistics, a typical home/business invasion robbery in Canada is carried out by strangers 68% of the time in which a weapon is present 62% of the time (firearms 33%, Knives or cutting instruments 30% other weapons 42%) during the home/business invasion and victims sustain injuries in 50% of the cases. [4]

Taking into account the above mentioned statistics, it is not surprising that home/business owners are looking for a home intrusion detection system to safeguard their families and property. However, they are finding it more difficult to protect their families, homes and businesses with the skyrocketing pricing of commercial alarm systems. For example, Vivint will charge around $700 just for the basic starter equipment package and a monthly monitoring fee between $30 and $45 dollars per month on a 42 to 60 month contract; that is between $1300 and $2700 per year!

According to research studies, homes with a monitored security system are 2.2 times less likely to be burglarized, and business with a monitored security system are 4.5 times less likely to be burglarized. In addition, 85% of police chiefs recommend the installation of monitored security systems.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:

MAIDS (Meis Intrusion Detection System) real-world project satisfies the following requirements:
1.	Provide an affordable (under $250) home or business intrusion detection system (IDS).
2.	Provide a small and easily deployed DYY IDS for any space.
3.	Provide the user with a simple IDS interface.
4.	Provide rapid-response and reliable multiple-channel intrusion alerts in real-time.
5.	Eliminate monthly monitoring fee (self-monitoring system).
6.	Provide database information for authorities use.
7.	No contract required.
